# 📘 Welcome

This space is part of an ongoing journey — not a destination.  
I’m someone who explores technology layer by layer, quietly and patiently.  
What you'll find here is not a showcase, but a reflection of what I'm learning, building, and understanding over time.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Creating this portfolio is not about showing off — it’s about opening a door.  
I’m doing this to find meaningful work and stable opportunities in areas I genuinely enjoy.

---

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find Here

- Personal learning notes and experiments  
- Projects rooted in curiosity and low-level understanding  
- Work-in-progress ideas, not polished products  
- A slow-growing collection of things that help me learn how computers actually work

I enjoy topics that go deep — but I don’t limit myself to just one area.  
Sometimes it’s hardware, sometimes software, sometimes both at once.

---

## 🔍 Approach

- I like working close to the system: control, timing, behavior
- I learn by trying, breaking, fixing, and reflecting
- I value small, complete things over big, half-finished ones
- I write code to understand — not just to build

This portfolio evolves as I do. There’s no roadmap set in stone.

## 📁 Projects (Selected)

> _I update this section as I go — some are public, some are private, some are still in notebooks._

- Minimalist hardware control examples  
- Simulated low-level systems behaviors  
- Self-experiments with timers, memory, and protocol logic  
- Explorations into how booting, loading, and configuration actually happen

## 🚧 Under Construction

I’m still organizing, cleaning, and writing about things I’ve been working on quietly.  
Not everything is here yet — and that’s okay. It’s a work in progress, like me.

## 📫 Contact

This space is public because I’m open to work and learning opportunities.  
If you're curious about what I do or want to talk about systems-level things, feel free to reach out via GitHub or wherever I’ve linked.
