- The microprocessor - consolidation of all the components of a central processing unit (CPU) of a computer on a single chip of silicon - was born in 1971. The first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, contained about 2300 transistors.

- Currents in Perspective: What's consider a lot or a little amount of current? It's a good idea to have a gauge of comparison when you start tinkering with electronic devices. Here are some examples:a 100-W lightbulb draws about 1 A; a microwave draws 8 to 13 ; a laptop computer, 2 to 3 A; an electric fan, 1 A; a television, 1 to 3 A; a toster, 7 to 10 A; a fluorescent light, 1 to 2 A; a radio/stereo, 1 to 4 A; a typical LED, 20 mA; a mobile (smart) phone accessing the web uses around 200 mA; an advance low-power microchip (individual), a few $\micro A$ to perhaps even several *pA*; an automobile starter, around 200 A; a lightning strike, around 1000 A; a sufficient amount of current to induce cardiac/respiratory arrest, around 100 mA to 1 A.
